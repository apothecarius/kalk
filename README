TODO
- the derivation of exponentiations is far too simple, there will probably be examples where it will fail

- when theres derivation, there should also be antiderivation/integration

- putting parentheses around termparts where appropriate would enhance readability of the toString method

- a toString method that creates latex code would be great

- a reduction function that could
	- group divisions with common divisors
	- solve parts without variables

- a parser for plaintext inputs (that crashes for ambiguous input)



- and dont forget to test everything
